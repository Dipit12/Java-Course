// Concepts to go through to understand strings better
    -> String Pool
        -> Its basically a separate memory storage, inside the heap
        eg: String a ="Dipit"
            String b = "Dipit";
            Both a & b would point to the same pool which contains the string "Dipit"
            If we change the string through the reference var name, then it would not be changed for b, though they are pointing towards the same string because of immutability
    -> Immutability
